My original plan was:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGet accelerations from the IMU\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDouble integrate the accelerations (after subtracting gravity) over time to trace the 3D position of the wand tip over time\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMatch the pattern formed by the wand tip movements against some stored patterns for various spells\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is stupid! Step 2 does more harm than good. Sure, the transformation from accelerations to a position trace is an intuitive next step with potential visual appeal. But it adds no meaningful information to the data. Worse, it increases noise in the data. The inexact (ie, very noisy) estimate of gravity, when subtracted from the acceleration vector, pollutes every measurement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, we can jump directly from Step 1 to Step 3. We can store the raw acceleration values for various spells as reference data, and then try to match it against the accelerations measured from the performed spell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"time-warping\"\u003eTime Warping\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo compare two different wand movements, a good starting point is calculating the Euclidean distance between the samples of the raw acceleration values. This is like taking the time-varying waveform of the acceleration of one movement and subtracting it from the other. The closer the result is to 0, the better the match. The main problem with this method is the varying speed of the wand: the movements may not necessarily be of the same duration, so the waveforms will not line up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is naturally some variation in the duration it takes to perform the wand movement for a spell. For me, it can vary between 0.5s to 1.2s for the same spell. The solution to this part is easy: we can \u0026ldquo;stretch\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;compress\u0026rdquo; the time axis of the waveform by interpolating the sampled readings. However, this does not solve the problem entirely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsider these 3 Alohomora wand movements. Image 3 is just a slower version of image 2, which can be matched by compressing the time period of image 3. However, images 1 and 2 are slightly different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"alohomora.webp\" alt=\"Alohomora\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the first image, the wand traces the circular part relatively quickly as compared to the second image. But both the wand movements take the same amount of time. This difference cannot be compensated by stretching or compressing the time period. But we still need to be able to determine that both the wand movements are for the same spell! For example, here are the readings of two wand movements for the same spell in the data that I collected:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"measurements_115_117.png\" alt=\"Measurements 115 and 117\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth the measurements have 64 samples each, sampled at 100Hz, so we don\u0026rsquo;t need to stretch or compress any of them. However, the movements don\u0026rsquo;t line up together. Measurement 115 has a peak of \u003ccode\u003eaY\u003c/code\u003e at around 350ms, but measurement 117 has a trough of \u003ccode\u003eaY\u003c/code\u003e around the same time. A simple Euclidean distance would show a huge difference between the two!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately, there\u0026rsquo;s an algorithm to solve exactly this problem: \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_time_warping\"\u003eDynamic Time Warping\u003c/a\u003e. It effectively distorts the time axis. Instead of stretching/compressing the whole axis, some parts of it are stretched and some are compressed. The following image shows how the \u003ccode\u003eaY\u003c/code\u003e values of measurements 115 and 117 are compared, first using the raw Euclidean distance, and then using FastDTW (FastDTW is an approximate DTW algorithm that runs in \u003ccode\u003eO(n)\u003c/code\u003e time instead of \u003ccode\u003eO(N^2)\u003c/code\u003e of the standard DTW).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"dtw_effect.png\" alt=\"Effect of DTW\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe distance between the two measurements is reduced by more than 50% when using DTW.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"next-steps\"\u003eNext Steps\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA fun fact about DTW: It\u0026rsquo;s used for speech recognition. This means that I can use the same algorithm to map incantations to spells when I put a microphone in my wand!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut before I can dream of that, I need to implement the DTW algorithm. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find any existing DTW libraries for ESP32, so I\u0026rsquo;d have to implement it from scratch. There are many flavours and optimizations for DTW for different use cases. For my wand, I need:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePerfect matching: I never want a movement to match the wrong spell.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLow memory consumption: Since I need it to run on the wand microcontroller, which only has a few hundred KBs of RAM.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFast matching: I don\u0026rsquo;t want to perform a spell and then wait 5 seconds for it to take effect.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, I need to get back to doing a thorough literature review to find out about all the possible optimizations and whether they help me.

I used the plastic cover of my tin whistle as a makeshift wand body. I soldered an MPU-6050 sensor with long multicoloured wires and put it inside the wand body, with paper stuffed behind it to hold it in place. I also put a button on the breadboard, which I would hold down when performing some wand movement, to know when to start recording the IMU data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI initially wanted to start experimenting with an Arduino Uno, but realized soon that its 2KB RAM was tragically insufficient for my use case. I then used an ESP32 D1 Mini as the microcontroller. It\u0026rsquo;s small enough that it could fit inside the wand\u0026rsquo;s body (which, of course, would be required in the final wand), but I kept it outside for now while I was still experimenting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"wand_circuit.jpg\" alt=\"Wand Circuit\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"data-collection\"\u003eData collection\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy wand has an inherent orientation directionality because the IMU will always measure the acceleration due to gravity. Due to this, I wanted to record data for analysis in different orientations of the wand. If we say taht the side of the wand where the MPU-6050 is visible as the main face, then I wanted to record data with the face up, face turned left and face turned right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started collecting data by trying out the wand movements for \u003ca href=\"https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Unlocking_Charm?file=Alohomora-0.gif\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eAlohomora\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Wand-Lighting_Charm?file=LumosGesture.png\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eLumos\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. I took 170 readings in total:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e1 - 50: Alohomora, face up\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e51 - 70: Alohomora, face turned left\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e71 - 90: Alohomora, turned right\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e91 - 110: Lumos, face up\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e111 - 130: Lumos, face turned left\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e131 - 150: Lumos, face turned right\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e151 - 170: Lumos, face turned at some random angle between right and up\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe IMU data was collected at a sampling rate of approx. 100Hz. Each reading comprised 6 values: The x, y \u0026amp; z accelerometer measurements, and the x, y \u0026amp; z gyroscope measurements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sample plot for measurement 117 (Lumos, face turned left):\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"measurement_117.png\" alt=\"Measurement 117\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"data-analysis\"\u003eData Analysis\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started by plotting some rudimentary visualizations. I was excited to see that I could \u003cem\u003eobviously\u003c/em\u003e make out the movement in those plots. For example, this is the scatter plot for aY vs aX, for measurements 111 - 130 (Lumos, face turned left), and you can easily see the movement pattern:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"lumos_left_ax_ay.png\" alt=\"Lumos, face turned left, aY vs aX\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnthralled, I quickly began with my planned next step: double integrate the accelerations with time to get the 3D position over time. For this, I needed to subtract the effects of gravity from my readings. I could not just subtract 9.8m/s\u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e from a fixed axis, because the wand could be in different orientations. I tried 2 different ways to solve this, both of which should work for all wand orientations, but with the assumption that the orientation of the want doesn\u0026rsquo;t change during the spell:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePossibly, the wand is still at the beginning and the end of the spell. Then, the average of the first and the last readings should give the gravity vector.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom the whole set of measurements, find out those where the magnitude of the acceleration is close to 9.8m/s\u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e. The average of these measurements would give the gravity vector.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, none of these ideas worked. The minor changes in the orientation of the wand during the spell caused errors large enough that the positions I calculated had no resemblance to the wand movement I had performed. Here is a sample of the position over time for measurement 73 (Alohomora, face turned right):\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"wand_position_73.png\" alt=\"Calculated wand position, measurement 73\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis does not look like Alohomora at all, and my wand certainly didn\u0026rsquo;t move 2 metres while performing the spell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe issue was that my calculated gravity vector did not correctly represent gravity during the whole period of performing the spell. Perhaps I needed to use the gyro data to somehow find out when the orientation of the wand changed? But at this point, I was utterly disappointed and decided that it was a problem for later.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":null,"image":{"caption":"","focal_point":""},"permalink":"https://dryairship.github.io/post/magic-wand-2/","title":"Building a magic wand: Part 2"},{"content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis blog post is part of a series of posts on my attempt to build an electronic magic wand. \u003ca href=\"/tags/magic-wand/\"\u003eClick here\u003c/a\u003e to view all the posts.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne day, I was browsing instagram and saw an advertisement for a \u0026ldquo;magic wand\u0026rdquo; that spewed fire, like \u003ca href=\"https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Fire-Making_Spell\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eIncendio\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.

I was tempted to get one, but then deemed it a fire hazard for my apartment with lots of wood and cloth all around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, as with most things I find interesting, I started wondering how I\u0026rsquo;d build it if I had to build one myself. I got sidetracked in my thinking and arrived at a solution for an even better wand: one that does not spew fire, but can do \u003cem\u003eother things\u003c/em\u003e, through the magic of science and technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-science-of-spells\"\u003eThe science of spells\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerforming a spell isn\u0026rsquo;t as simple as \u0026ldquo;\u003cem\u003epoint the wand, say something\u003c/em\u003e\u0026rdquo;.

That would measure the z, y and z accelerations as the wand moves. I could then subtract gravity from it to get the accelerations solely due to the wand\u0026rsquo;s motion, then double-integrate it to get the 3-D position over time. The result would trace the path of the tip of the wand, which I could compare against stored patterns to determine which spell was cast.

When people asked me my branch in my first year, I would say \u0026ldquo;abhi tak aerospace\u0026rdquo; (aerospace for now). Yes I was mocked for that, but I used to join in the laughter too. After all, I was overconfident and believed that I would somehow figure it out even if I didn\u0026rsquo;t get my branch changed to CSE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo in my first semester, I got an SPI of 10.

I got an SPI of 8.6, and my CPI went from 10.0 to 9.3. And so I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get my branch changed to CSE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0026rsquo;t too unhappy about it. I had faith in IITK\u0026rsquo;s famed academic flexibility. My motive for switching to CSE was not to get a good offer in campus placements. There were plenty of examples of non-CSE people getting lucrative job offers (glad to now be added to that list) and plenty more examples of off-campus job offers being significantly better than campus placement offers (again, glad to now be added to that list). I wanted to switch to CSE because that\u0026rsquo;s what I was naturally good at, or at least that stuff was more exciting and easier for me than physics or chemistry or maths. So that was when I decided I would do a double major, or minors, or just random CSE courses, to pursue my interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"lucky-me\"\u003eLucky me\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA good thing happened to me in the summers. My first year summers were pretty loaded with aquatics summer camp, IITK\u0026rsquo;s New York Office internship, CSE@IITK Summer of Code, and a couple of SnT projects. So I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to take up a summer course. But almost every other summer-stay student was doing one. So, under peer pressure, I decided half-heartedly to fill the summer courses form 15 minutes before the deadline. I added just one course preference - for a course where I knew that the professor was highly lenient in grading, so that I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to put in much effort considering my already packed schedule (it was probably the only time I chose a course like this).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow, luckily, I got that course! I didn\u0026rsquo;t think too much of it then. It was only later that I realized how important this one course was in the whole scheme of things. This course cleared a slot in my 3rd sem, which, with the convenient aerospace template, allowed me to do ESO207A (Data Structures \u0026amp; Algorithms) in that sem, which later enabled me to do more CSE courses at all the right times. So yes, I owe it to luck that I got these 5 minors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"minor-1-algorithms\"\u003eMinor 1: Algorithms\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am very interested in algorithms. So the algorithms minor was something I had specifically planned for. Doing ESO207 in the 3rd sem enabled me to do CS345A (Algorithms II) in the 5th sem. The sad part is that usually, CS345A professors don\u0026rsquo;t allow non-CSE people without approved minors/double-major to enrol in that course. Again, I was lucky in this regard. In my 5th sem, Prof. Surender Baswana was offering CS345A. He put only the condition, that students from other branches should have an A grade in ESO207A. So he gladly accepted my course request without any prejudice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCS345A was not easy at all, and I could only manage to get a B. Yet, the algorithms minor was actually the only minor I truly wanted, so I was determined to complete it. Prof. Baswana offered CS648A (Randomized algorithms) in my 6th sem. Again, he gladly accepted my course request, and was very accommodating to conduct extra lectures to teach probability pre-requisites that CSE people learn in their 2nd year. I got a B in this course too, but learnt a lot of interesting stuff. Thus, my algorithms minor was complete.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"minor-2-theory-of-computing\"\u003eMinor 2: Theory of Computing\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the form to opt for minors was floated, I had filled in the following 3 preferences: Algorithms, Computer Systems, and Theory of Computing. Due to my not-so-high CPI at the time, I was allotted only one minor: Theory of Computing. I had already done ESO207A. And because of my interest in cybersecurity, I wanted to do CS641A (Modern Cryptology), which was an optional course in this minor. So I did that in my 6th sem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my 7th sem, I was looking for interesting courses to do. And there were tons of interesting courses being offered - on IoT, Game Theory, Hardware Security, Cyber-Physical Systems, Cybersecurity of Critical Infrastructures, etc. But they either clashed with my other courses, or I didn\u0026rsquo;t meet the prereqs. So I looked up the syllabus of CS340A (Theory of Computation), which was a compulsory course for this minor, and it didn\u0026rsquo;t seem too bad to me. Not wanting to \u0026ldquo;waste credits\u0026rdquo;, I took it up, thinking that I\u0026rsquo;d drop it if I found it boring, as my CSE friends had warned me that it was a boring course. Surprisingly, I found it rather interesting. I\u0026rsquo;d actually count it among the top 10 most interesting courses I\u0026rsquo;ve done at IITK. And thus, my minor in Theory of Computation was done too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"minor-3-linguistic-theory\"\u003eMinor 3: Linguistic Theory\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis one was a surprise for me. During our orientation, we had to fill in our HSS preferences. ENG124A (Language \u0026amp; Society) was my second last preference. I thought that I was unlucky to have been allotted this course, since I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to learn any more ENG(lish). I was not at all excited about it, but it turned out to be absolute fun. I found it so interesting that now if you\u0026rsquo;d ask me to tell you a random fact, I\u0026rsquo;d probably tell you something I learnt in this course. (This is just one example of how sometimes you think things are going wrong for you, but they actually turn out to be good - this happens more often than you may think). I think it also had to do with the fact that Prof. Achla Raina is a great teacher. Anyway, I was also learning Spanish at that time, so I found it quite relatable too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater, I found out that there is an even better HSS Level 2 course that would be more relevant to me - ENG408A (Second Language Acquisition). Since I was trying to improve my Spanish, I thought maybe this would teach me a few things that would make my task easy. So I filled that as my first preference in the HSS lottery. But I got something else. I dropped the course that I got and wrote the mail to the ENG408A prof requesting the course. He readily accepted my course request.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, for my last HSS Level 2, I put my first preference as ENG423A (Current Issues in Linguistics) because: 1. I had already started loving linguistics by now; 2. Prof. Achla Raina was going to teach it (did I mention I got an A* in ENG124A?); and 3. A minor in \u0026ldquo;humanities and social sciences\u0026rdquo; would sound cool coming from someone who studied at an IIT (?). By the grace of Pingala, I was allotted my first preference. Interestingly got an A* in this course too. This completed my minor in linguistic theory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"minor-4-machine-learning--applications\"\u003eMinor 4: Machine Learning \u0026amp; Applications\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI never really liked machine learning until my final year. I had tried learning ML but never got around to it (proof: some blog posts I wrote a couple of years ago). I was prejudiced against it because I disliked the fact that it involved a lot of math that was way too difficult for me. However, during my Amazon internship after my 3rd year, I had to do a course on Machine Learning on Amazon\u0026rsquo;s internal learning portal. I think it was mistakenly assigned to me by my manager, but I completed it nevertheless. And now I had a certificate that claimed that I have a working knowledge of machine learning? Funny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen after my internship, I thought: I already know some stuff about coding ML models; what if I go ahead and try to actually learn the theory? So I requested CS771A (Introduction to Machine Learning) in the add-drop period. Since this course is always in very high demand, I didn\u0026rsquo;t really think I\u0026rsquo;d get it. I was mostly indifferent to whether or not the request would be accepted (except for not wanting to \u0026ldquo;waste credits\u0026rdquo;), as I wasn\u0026rsquo;t much of an ML fan. But I think the professor accepted all Y18 course requests, so I got to do this too. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t much fun, honestly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, I had told Prof. Arnab Bhattacharya that I would do a course with him (I had worked with him in my first semester on Pingala security). I really just wanted to do CS315A (Principles of Database Systems), as he used to offer it. But I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to do it then, for some reason. So in my 7th sem, he offered CS685A (Data Mining), and a very close friend of mine wanted to do it for her minor in ML. So I decided to do this course too, to work with her on the same group project for once. The icing on the cake was that we (our course project group) were the only 3 students who got an A* in the course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd thus, even though I didn\u0026rsquo;t plan it, I got this minor in Machine Learning \u0026amp; Applications. I find it quite strange because even my overconfident self is not at all confident in ML, despite having this minor. Yup, it\u0026rsquo;s a joke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"minor-5-computer-systems\"\u003eMinor 5: Computer Systems\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis has to be the most interesting CS minor. It has all the juicy CS courses like computer organization, architecture, databases, networks, compilers, software engineering, etc. You know - the stuff that a computer engineer actually works on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was my final semester, and there were very few courses that I needed to do for graduation, so I had much more leeway regarding the extra courses I could do. And perhaps for the first time, neither CS315A (Principles of Database Systems) nor CS425A (Computer Networks) clashed with anything in my template. So I requested for both of them on Pingala, and both the professors accepted my course request without any hassle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe situation was quite contrasting in the two courses. I scored 99% in CS425A and missed out on the A* by one mark. On the other hand, I got the second C grade of my IITK life in CS315A, owing to a strange turn of events in the endsem. And with this, I had my fifth minor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"minor-6-one-that-almost-happened\"\u003eMinor 6: One that almost happened\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also had an approved minor in Industrial and Management Engineering (I had filled that in just for fun because my friends were doing it, and somehow I even got that). I had enough free slots that I surely could have done the required courses. In fact, I even registered for one: IME636A (Introduction to Game Theory). The course, particularly the teaching, was not like I had expected. It was utterly dull, and I wasn\u0026rsquo;t very enthusiastic about completing the IME minor, so I dropped the course. (Yes, the only time I ever \u0026ldquo;wasted credits\u0026rdquo;).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"conclusion\"\u003eConclusion\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo you see - I wasn\u0026rsquo;t really trying to \u0026ldquo;collect\u0026rdquo; as many minors as possible. I was just trying to do the courses that I was interested in. I did many more \u0026ldquo;extra\u0026rdquo; courses purely out of interest, that counted neither towards my graduation requirements nor towards any minor: CS628A (Computer Systems Security), CS658A (Malware Analysis \u0026amp; Intrusion Detection), CS350A (Principles of Programming Languages), etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIITK\u0026rsquo;s academic flexibility is not a myth. In every semester after the first year, I did close to 65 credits, and I would have done more had I been allowed to. At IITK, you can truly learn things you are interested in; you just have to put in efforts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI admit that I got lucky a few times. Sometimes the Pingala/OARS algorithm allotted me the right courses, while sometimes I got the right professors offering courses in the right semesters. And, of course, I am grateful to the aerospace department template for being so facilitative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut more than that, I think it was just my desire to learn as much as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":null,"image":{"caption":"","focal_point":""},"permalink":"https://dryairship.github.io/post/how-i-got-the-5-minors-at-iitk/","title":"How I Completed 5 Minors at IITK"},{"content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.palantir.com/\"\u003ePalantir\u003c/a\u003e is a company that builds tools that are used to make data-driven decisions. Palantir Gotham is an operating system that helps in decision-making in the intelligence domain (most famously at the US Department of Defense). Palantir Foundry is an operating system that helps in decision-making in the business domain (at companies like Airbus and Morgan Stanley).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI first got to know about Palantir from \u003ca href=\"https://sakshamsharma.com/\"\u003eSaksham Sharma\u003c/a\u003e (a Y14 IITK alumnus), who told me he\u0026rsquo;d gone to Palantir\u0026rsquo;s office in London for an interview. My interest in Palantir was renewed in December 2021, when I found out that \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/durgeshra\"\u003eDurgesh Agrawal\u003c/a\u003e (a Y17 IITK alumnus) had started working there. I researched about the company and found it pretty interesting. Plus, nothing could top working in London.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"application\"\u003eApplication\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo in December 2021, I applied for the software engineering roles in Palantir\u0026rsquo;s London office. I had the option of asking Durgesh for a referral, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t strike me then, so I directly submitted my application through Palantir\u0026rsquo;s website without any referral. I guess I didn\u0026rsquo;t ask for a referral because I was reasonably content with DevRev\u0026rsquo;s offer and was not trying too hard to go anywhere else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePalantir, interestingly, has two software engineering roles. One is the usual \u0026ldquo;Software Engineer\u0026rdquo; role, wherein people work on the software in Palantir\u0026rsquo;s office. The other is the \u0026ldquo;Forward Deployed Software Engineer\u0026rdquo; role, wherein people travel around and work directly with the customers to build tools for them. Many people hate the Forward Deployed role, while many believe it\u0026rsquo;s the best thing one could do. It has its pros and cons, but I was mostly neutral towards it. So I applied for both the roles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"karat-round\"\u003eKarat Round\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5 days later, I received a mail to schedule a screening call with a Karat interviewer. Karat is a company that specializes in doing technical screening for software companies. Normally, companies give out a test for applicants to complete before shortlisting them for the interviews. Karat intends to replace those tests with 1hr \u0026ldquo;Karat rounds\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe interviewer spent the first 10 minutes or so asking MCQ-type questions about basic computer science concepts like time complexity, data structures, etc. I think he asked me 5 questions and then said he had 2 more bonus questions that he couldn\u0026rsquo;t ask because of lack of time for this part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, the interviewer pasted an algorithmic question on the screen and asked me to solve it. He mentioned twice that it was more important to solve and implement the solution than trying to come up with an efficient solution. I found this rather stupid, because it meant one could just brute force everything. We had to compile and run the code on the provided test cases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI solved the first question quite easily. The second question took me some time. And there were only 10 minutes left for the last question, but I was still able to complete it within time. I\u0026rsquo;d say the difficulty level was easy, as even though I was trying to come up with the simplest possible brute-forcey solution, I was able to solve all the 3 questions in O(n) time complexity, and I was pretty sure that they couldn\u0026rsquo;t be solved in time less than that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"recruiter-call\"\u003eRecruiter Call\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that time, all the employees at Palantir were on a 3-week long company-wide holiday, so I didn\u0026rsquo;t get to the next steps until January. In January, my recruiter set up a call with me. I cannot simply explain how amazing, friendly and helpful he was. Undoubtedly the best recruiter I\u0026rsquo;ve ever come across. My friends have had worse experiences at Palantir, so I\u0026rsquo;d say I just got lucky to have him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe call was to discuss my background and explain the interview process to me. A friend of mine was rejected in this round, so I was quite wary of it. But my recruiter was so awesome, it didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like an interview at all. He gave me lots of helpful information regarding the upcoming interviews and clarified all my doubts. He told me that since I had applied for both the Software Engineer and the Forward Deployed Software Engineer roles, they\u0026rsquo;d interview me for both and decide at the end regarding which role they want to give me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy \u0026ldquo;Virtual Onsite\u0026rdquo; rounds were scheduled about 10 days later. I could only curse COVID - for without it, this would have been a real onsite round, and I\u0026rsquo;d have gone to London for the interviews.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Virtual Onsite round had 3 1hr interviews scheduled consecutively in a 3-hour window: Decomposition, Coding and Learning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"decomposition-round\"\u003eDecomposition Round\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the round I was most scared of. According to Palantir\u0026rsquo;s interview prep resources, I had to take a complex problem, break it down into smaller pieces, and then build a solution. Apparently, it was supposed to be like a system-design round, but different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem that I got was a very vaguely stated real-world problem. I was told to assume I had a database containing certain records (the data was adequately specified). I had to use this data to build something to solve the problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI eventually designed an application, and I think I did pretty well in solving the problem.

The questions were about the same level as the Karat round. I solved all the 3 well within time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere, I had a funny incident. The second problem I was given could be easily solved using topological sort. While discussing, I mentioned the term \u0026ldquo;topological sort\u0026rdquo; to the interviewers. And then when I was implementing, I wrote the code in the way that was most natural to me. Then after implementing it, I suddenly recalled that when we were taught toplogical sort in our ESO207A course at IITK, we used something like intime/outtime to do that, while my algorithm was an extremely simple recursive one. So I began doubting my code, and spent a lot of time trying to think of any edge cases where it would fail. I just couldn\u0026rsquo;t think of why we would be taught the monstrosity of intime/outtime in the class if toposort was just as simple as I had implemented it. After thinking for some time, I gave up, and told the interviewers that my algorithm was correct. And it was :p\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo later, when my recruiter called me to give me feedback, he told me that the interviewers thought I was intentionally pretending to be stuck, even though I knew topological sort and had written the correct code. They thankfully didn\u0026rsquo;t take it negatively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"learning-round\"\u003eLearning Round\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this round, I was supposed to be taught something new, and I had to solve problems using the newly learnt concept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think my vast development experience helped me here, because even though whatever they taught me was actually new to me, I was able to relate it to something I had previously done in another language, and thus I was easily able to grasp it. I solved all the problems in this round well before time too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"hiring-manager-round\"\u003eHiring Manager Round\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I had passed the 3 interviews on the virtual onsite day, and now I had moved to the final interview round. As I had been told that my decomposition round was not as good as they wanted it to be, I was supposed to be given a decomposition problem in the final round too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hiring Manager was a great guy and seemed fun to talk to. He asked general questions about my background, and seemed interested in my online election manager project. In the second half, I again messed up with the decomposition problem. I had solved everything correctly and properly, except that I completely forgot about a tiny aspect of the problem. In the end, the hiring manager pointed out that I didn\u0026rsquo;t solve this part, so I hurriedly incorporated its solution into my larger solution. The larger solution was quite well designed, so I had no trouble incorporating this small thing into it, and I was successfully able to complete the solution by the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"strange-situation\"\u003eStrange situation\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next day after my final round, my recruiter scheduled a call with me. He told me that it was a bit of a \u0026ldquo;strange situation\u0026rdquo; because the Hiring Manager strongly wanted Palantir to hire me, but not for the software engineering roles. He was really impressed with my skills and believed that I would easily be able to learn whatever skills I lacked then, but he just wanted me to work with the cybersecurity team because that\u0026rsquo;s where I would most enjoy working.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the cybersecurity team were reluctant to hire a new grad - they only hire experienced people. But due to the special recommendation of the hiring manager, they agreed to interview me. My recruiter told me that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t ever happen, which is why it was a strange situation for him as well as for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I didn\u0026rsquo;t know whether to be happy or upset. I had reasons to be upset - they were clear that they didn\u0026rsquo;t want me for the software engineering roles, and I knew that they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t hire a new grad in the cybersecurity team, so my chances of getting into Palantir were nil. On the other hand, I had reasons to be happy - have you ever heard of someone who impressed the hiring manager so much to have a special interview conducted for themself? I surely must be something!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"cybersecurity-round\"\u003eCybersecurity Round\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cybersecurity round was scheduled a few days later. If selected, I would join in the \u0026ldquo;Application Security Engineer\u0026rdquo; position. I had checked out this role on Palantir\u0026rsquo;s website. It mentioned that candidates must have at least 3 years of software development or cybersecurity experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as the interview started, the interviewer told me that they don\u0026rsquo;t usually do this, but the Hiring Manager was quite adamant about getting me interviewed for this role. So I asked him if the requirement of the \u0026ldquo;3+ years of experience\u0026rdquo; was a strict one, or if they had anyone with lesser experience in the team. He replied that no one in the team had less than 7 years of experience! And at that moment, I was 100% sure they would not take me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe actual interview was fun. It was the first time I was interviewed for a cybersecurity role, and I think I did pretty well. He described to me a simple system and just asked me to enumerate all the things I\u0026rsquo;d do to secure it. Initially, I was quite slow, because I had absolutely no prior idea of what cybersecurity interviews are like, and I was just trying to think of the possible attacks on the system, so that I could defend it. Then about 5 minutes later, I got the hang of it. I started picking up every small component of the system, and started describing how I would secure it. I guess initially, the interviewer was prejudiced and didn\u0026rsquo;t expect much from me. But once I started doing this, he began asking more questions about my approaches and then used to reply excitedly whenever I correctly answered something tricky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0026rsquo;t even cover like half (or even a quarter) of the components of the system by the time the interview ended. (Yes, there are just too many cyber threats - it\u0026rsquo;s extremely hard to even list all the possible attacks, let alone think of ways to defend against them). But I had correctly answered all his other questions about the technical details. I think I should have avoided describing some smaller security measures for being too trivial, and should have focused more on comprehensively covering the security of the entire system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNevertheless, it was a delightful experience. I would love to partake in more cybersecurity interviews in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-end\"\u003eThe end\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe very next day, I received the rejection mail from Palantir.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough it didn\u0026rsquo;t work out, I\u0026rsquo;d say Palantir\u0026rsquo;s interviews were absolutely the best ones I\u0026rsquo;ve ever participated in. I\u0026rsquo;m just amazed at the fact that Palantir considered me for a role that doesn\u0026rsquo;t even hire new grads. It made me feel quite special, and I\u0026rsquo;m very grateful to Palantir for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":null,"image":{"caption":"","focal_point":"center"},"permalink":"https://dryairship.github.io/post/interview-experience-palantir/","title":"Interview Experience: Palantir"},{"content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://devrev.ai\"\u003eDevRev\u003c/a\u003e is a developer centric CRM platform. It was founded by Dheeraj Pandey (former Nutanix CEO) and Manoj Agarwal (former executive at Nutanix). DevRev raised $50M in the seed round, which is probably one of the largest ever seed fundings in the history of Silicon Valley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI first got to know about DevRev through \u003ca href=\"https://yugeshk.github.io/\"\u003eyugeshk\u003c/a\u003e. I liked the idea of the product, and was attracted towards the possibility of working in a startup. One of the best things about working in a startup is that you get to build really cool stuff from scratch, instead of having to maintain legacy code. The downside is that it is uncertain if the startup will make it big. However, since DevRev\u0026rsquo;s founders had the experience of building and growing a company (i.e., Nutanix), this fear was alleviated to a large extent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"application\"\u003eApplication\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI applied for the \u0026ldquo;Software Developer: University Hire\u0026rdquo; role directly through DevRev\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Join Us\u0026rdquo; page, without any employee referral (which, btw, I don\u0026rsquo;t think exists in DevRev yet). DevRev\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Join Us\u0026rdquo; page has an extremely cute video (which I played on loop for about 5-6 times, because it\u0026rsquo;s so beautiful), that really made me feel that DevRev would be an amazing company for me. I also joined DevRev\u0026rsquo;s discord server.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"test\"\u003eTest\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI received an automated mail for a test on the CodeSignal platform. The test had some MCQs about basic algorithms and data structures, and some programming questions. I felt that the programming questions were fairly simple algorithmically, but had slightly complex implementations. That is to say, there could be very complicated ways to implement the solutions, but if you think and plan stuff before starting (which is what I did), you could come up with really simple and beautiful code. I mention this because by looking at the problems, it would seem that anyone with a fairly decent programming experience would be able to solve them, but maybe DevRev looks at your implementations to decide whether or not to proceed with your application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"screening\"\u003eScreening\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the test, I was called for an initial screening round. This was the most fun interview I\u0026rsquo;d ever had till then. It was a mix of behavioural questions, coding problems, debugging problems, math questions and logic puzzles. The interviewer was extremely helpful and fun to talk to. When I was given a math problem, I came up with an intuitive answer almost immediately, but was stuck trying to prove that my intuition was correct, and the interviewer helped me in that. I had also read most of the logical puzzles in my childhood, so I answered them almost immediately too. The coding and debugging problems were new and interesting, but easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"technical-interview-1\"\u003eTechnical Interview #1\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, I had the first technical interview. the questions were easy/moderate. But for some reason, I was unable to solve a simple problem related to linked lists. The interviewer gave me tons of hints (and even drew on a whiteboard to explain), and only then was I able to solve it. At the end, I felt that the interview went bad (particularly because I felt that the linked list problem was an easy one, and I think I should have solved it without needing any hints at all). But somehow, I was selected for future rounds. In fact, in a later interview, Manoj Agarwal (the founder) told me that this interviewer gave me the most positive review.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"youio\"\u003eyou.io\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen building a company, it is very important to choose people who are not only technically strong, but also a good culture fit for the company. DevRev has a questionnaire which they call you.io, in which they ask the candidates about themselves and their opinions on certain topics. It took me a long time to fill the form (and I also had to ask for a deadline extension because I was travelling back to IITK campus during that time). A friend of mine had his application rejected one day after he filled his you.io form, so clearly it is a very important step in DevRev\u0026rsquo;s application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"cultural-interview-1\"\u003eCultural Interview #1\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was my first every cultural/HR interview, and I think I did very poorly. Most of the questions were about teamwork in my past projects. I didn\u0026rsquo;t enjoy this interview, particularly because the entire theme of this 1 hr interview was \u0026ldquo;teamwork\u0026rdquo;, which made it monotonous and boring. Somehow, I also passed this interview. But I\u0026rsquo;d strongly suggest DevRev to expand the scope of this interview to other topics as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"technical-interview-2\"\u003eTechnical Interview #2\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, I had the second technical interview. It began with a few questions about my past projects. Then I was asked to design some technology that I had mentioned in my resume. I was not really prepared for a system design interview, but I tried to do the best I could. I just listed the expectations from the technology, the functionalities that will fulfull those expectations, the data structures that I would use, and the algorithms/implementaion of the functionalities. The interviewer seemed satisfied with that. Then I was asked to solve and implement a simple coding problem. Overall, I felt that the interview went good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"cultural-interview-2\"\u003eCultural Interview #2\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I had a second cultural interview. This interview was more like a conversation. The interviewer was just trying to get to know me better. There were very few random questions. Most questions were just \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; extensions to my previous responses - which actually made me think. I am very bad at HR interviews, but I enjoyed this one, and felt that it went rather well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"founder-interview\"\u003eFounder Interview\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, I had an interview with the founder, Manoj Agarwal. He gave me a brief feedback of all my interviews, and let me ask questions about DevRev. We discussed about IITK, entrepeneurship, and of course, DevRev. He asked me very few questions, and it almost seemed like he wasn\u0026rsquo;t evaluating me at all, but just talking to me. Talking to him was just like talking to any other IITK senior. In the end, I gained some insights about what all things a founder has to worry about, how a company is built, how to care for employees, etc. I liked that fact that he said that I could ask to schedule a call if I needed to talk to him, anytime, and for any reason whatsoever (I did ask him once to schedule a call to discuss a few things, and he was very happy to oblige).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"offer\"\u003eOffer\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, I received a call from DevRev with the offer. The offer was pretty lucrative, both in cash and stock components. I had a few questions, so I called the recruiter to clarify my doubts. I got a feeling that recruiter was annoyed that I actually read and analysed the terms in the offer letter instead of signing it straight away. At one point, I was told \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t you trust us?\u0026rdquo; when I asked a very valid question about a condition in the offer letter. This behaviour seemed strikingly different from my opinion of DevRev\u0026rsquo;s culture, and I was left a little disappointed and skeptical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a fun time interviewing with DevRev, and was very excited to have received an offer. I will not be joining DevRev right now, but I intend to closely monitor its progress, and hope that it grows into a really great company.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":null,"image":{"caption":"","focal_point":"Center"},"permalink":"https://dryairship.github.io/post/interview-experience-devrev/","title":"Interview Experience: DevRev"},{"content":"\u003cp\u003eIITKBucks was a Programming Club Project that I mentored in the Summer Camp 2020.

However, I just knew that it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t take me long to learn about the concepts and that I would be ready by the time the project begins.

Unplanned max pro :p\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI somehow explained what mining is. But how do I make sure people understood it? So I just randomly decided to give them a task (to \u003cem\u003emine\u003c/em\u003e a string), and called it Assignment 1. I didn\u0026rsquo;t know how many assignments there would be by the end of the project.

And then I just asked them to start building the client! I didn\u0026rsquo;t even tell them what a \u0026ldquo;client\u0026rdquo; was. Unplanned super ultra max pro. Thankfully, we had a great discussion on the structures, and people just forgot that they had been asked to start building the client :p\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"more-bloopers\"\u003eMore bloopers\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the next discussion, I explained about digital signatures, and gave an assignment to generate and verify signatures. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t experienced with the implementation of signatures, so I thought there were two major padding methods: OAEP and PKCS, and that we should prefer OAEP. I later found out that it is \u003ca href=\"https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/29354/why-not-use-oaep-for-signatures\"\u003enot recommended to use OAEP for signatures\u003c/a\u003e, and that we should use PSS instead.

I had to make some changes in the structure from what I had mentioned before (yes, because the earlier description was \u003cstrong\u003eunplanned\u003c/strong\u003e :p).

So I decided to have an assignment to build simple messaging clients for a distributed network, and then have a demo run of it. It was amazing. People enjoyed it. We were disrupted by \u003ca href=\"https://ngrok.com/\"\u003engrok\u003c/a\u003e\u0026rsquo;s free tier limitations, but other than that, it was wonderful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-fun-part\"\u003eThe fun part\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe subsequently discussed the lifecyle of a blockchain, transaction fees, block rewards, chain reorganisation, double spending, etc. Then we started working on the actual project. Since people had already implemented most of the logic of the project as assignments, it was quite simple. They just needed to connect those parts to appropriate endpoints.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"bloopers-return-\"\u003eBloopers return :(\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was all going nice. The next step was to mine new blocks. But there was a problem that I had overlooked. The mining function could run on the main thread or it would halt the server (since mining continues until either success or interruption). So we needed to do some multithreading here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a serious problem, since it would be a new thing for most of the students. I had assumed that we would not face any major blockers in the project development phase since all the new concepts would have been covered before that through assignments. So I just gave them a new assignment to have a server start a miner (from the first assignment) in parallel. Also, since this too was unplanned like most of the other stuff, I forgot to tell them to make an endpoint to stop the miner. :p\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThankfully, the students were more hard-working than I had assumed. They completed the assignment and finished the miner too. But wait, there was another thing I had overlooked. The frontend! We built the nodes, but how is the end user going to communicate with that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would have made everyone build a web app for this, but there were just 3-4 days remaining for our end-term presentation, and we needed to complete it by then. So I gave them the choice to build either a web app, a desktop app, or a CLI frontend. The time limit was tight, but the students delivered. :')\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-deployment\"\u003eThe Deployment\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had deployed my node at \u003ca href=\"https://iitkbucks.pclub.in\"\u003ehttps://iitkbucks.pclub.in\u003c/a\u003e, so that others may be able to test their applications with that.

So did the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe did a demo run of the application on the evening of 18th July, and it failed miserably. There were just too many problems. And we had the end-term presentation on the next day. However, the students were nice enough to work hard and fix all the bugs by the next morning. We had another demo at noon, and it worked perfectly! Oh the satisfaction! It still seems magical to me how the students managed to fix all the bugs in their applications in such a short span of time. :D\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"other-interesting-things\"\u003eOther interesting things\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"my-assignment-repo\"\u003eMy assignment repo\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had \u003ca href=\"https://dryairship.github.io/post/learn-me-a-haskell/\"\u003estarted learning Haskell\u003c/a\u003e around the same time that the project started. Quite overconfidently, I decided to do all the assignments in Haskell. The resolution turned out to be an epic fail.

I even started doing that. At one point, the coverage was 89%. I gave up after that, and now the coverage lies at a meagre 18% :p This is probably because this was the first time I was writing tests, and I had no idea how to test the complex functions that depended on the state of the application besides the input.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"java-3\"\u003eJava \u0026lt;3\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe students had complete freedom over the language they were going to use for their project.

That was a wonderful experience for me. It was like meeting an old lover, who\u0026rsquo;s trying to allure you again. :p Java still remains my second most favorite language. \u0026lt;3\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"channels-in-go\"\u003eChannels in go\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore this project, I had never properly worked with channels in go.

And since I\u0026rsquo;ve been a fan of languages that support automatic garbage collection, I never really had to worry about that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile working on my project, it completely slipped out of my mind that I would have to deallocate the memory too! However, my mentor Dongxu informed me that anything that derives from \u003ccode\u003eQObject\u003c/code\u003e would automatically be destroyed when its parent is destroyed! And since almost all of the classes in my project derive from \u003ccode\u003eQObject\u003c/code\u003e, I didn\u0026rsquo;t have to do anything about them. For those that didn\u0026rsquo;t, I switched to smart pointers instead of normal pointers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"m_-for-members\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003em_\u003c/code\u003e for members\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have seen the \u003ccode\u003em_\u003c/code\u003e prefix being used for variable names at a lot of places. I never really understood the reason. I used to believe that perhaps it is another way of saying \u003ccode\u003emy\u003c/code\u003e, as I had seen the use of \u003ca href=\"https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/355533/use-of-my-prefix-in-object-naming\"\u003ethe prefix \u003ccode\u003emy\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/a\u003e in variable/class names too (\u003ccode\u003eMyCar\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003emyDriver\u003c/code\u003e LoL).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInitially, I didn\u0026rsquo;t use the \u003ccode\u003em_\u003c/code\u003e prefix in my code. However, my mentor pointed out that \u003ca href=\"https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator-extending/coding-style.html#class-member-names\"\u003eQt Coding Style\u003c/a\u003e mentions that Qt uses the \u003ccode\u003em_\u003c/code\u003e prefix, and I\u0026rsquo;d have to update my code. It was really annoying TBH :p. Why would you unnecessarily add 2 extra characters to your variable names? There is some discussion about this ridiculous convention on a \u003ca href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13018189/what-does-m-variable-prefix-mean\"\u003eStackOverflow question\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"qt-on-go\"\u003eQt on Go!\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI recently found out about this repo \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/therecipe/qt\"\u003etherecipe/qt\u003c/a\u003e which enables you to write Qt applications in Go! This is actually so cool! I\u0026rsquo;ve been programming in so many languages, but whenever I needed to build a GUI application, I always had to fall back to Java. The simplicity of the Java Swing Framework is unmatched, and I never tried to learn a GUI framework for any other language. With this, I can build GUI applications in Go, using Qt.

The project was highly appreciated. Various people have starred the GitHub repo (some of whom I highly respect, some I don\u0026rsquo;t even know). Prof. Swaprava Nath mentioned in his comments that it was arguably the best project, and I was given a full score for the project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut having a good project to showcase is one thing. Having it deployed and used in the real life in quite another. Today, my application was used, in the \u003ca href=\"https://students.iitk.ac.in/ss/home/meetings/1st-2020-21/\"\u003e1st Meeting of the Students’ Senate, 2020-21\u003c/a\u003e for the elections for the student members for the various committees and councils of the Students\u0026rsquo; Senate of IIT Kanpur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough (surprisingly) none of the voters questioned the reliability of the application, I believe a proof should be provided nonetheless. The process used during the elections has been detailed in the \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/dryairship/online-election-manager/blob/project-track/report/report.pdf\"\u003ereport\u003c/a\u003e, so I recommend you to read that first. The only thing that isn\u0026rsquo;t obvious in the report is the defense against the various tactics that the server admin can use to try to change the results of the elections. In this blog post, I\u0026rsquo;ll mention a few things that server admin can do, and explain why that won\u0026rsquo;t work. Most importantly, you may think that the server admin can run arbitrary code on the server, instead of the claimed code. Well true, but I\u0026rsquo;ll prove that it still maintains the anonymity of the ballots and the veracity of the results.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, it is important to understand that I do not claim that the server admin cannot disrupt the elections. Obviously, they can just delete the database, and then we\u0026rsquo;ll not be able to calculate the results. But note that this is an issue in offline elections as well. Paper ballots? Well, someone responsible for transporting the ballots can just burn down all the ballots. EVMs? Someone responsible for transporting them can just destroy the EVMs. Obviously, if something like that happens in the real life, re-elections would be called. The key point, however, is that if something like this happens (destruction of ballots or EVMs), it must be brought to notice. I\u0026rsquo;ll prove below that the server admin cannot modify the database without being caught.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-happens-if-the-server-admin-tries-to-modifyadddelete-some-votes\"\u003eWhat happens if the server admin tries to modify/add/delete some votes?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis issue deals with the veracity of the results.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince the server admin has complete control over the database, they can try to do this. Further, a vote is not tied to any voter, but to a ballot ID. So for our context here, modification is equivalent to deleting N real votes and then adding back N fake votes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen a voter submits a vote, they are displayed the ballot IDs that were used for their votes. The voters can save these ballot IDs. When the results are published, the list of people who had voted is also published, along with all the ballot IDs and the corresponding choices (i.e. candidates).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe people who had voted can verify that they are on this list, and the non-voters can verify that they are not on this list. Also, the voters can verify that the ballot IDs they had been displayed after submitting their vote is on this list, and that the choices on this list match the choices they had submitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow we have 3 situations:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe server admin adds fake votes into the database\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn this case, the number of ballot IDs for a post will be more than the number of voters who had voted.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe server admin deletes some votes from the database\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn this case, the number of ballot IDs for a post will be less than the number of voters who had voted.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe server admin deletes N real votes and adds N fake votes\u003c/strong\u003e\nIn this case, the people whose votes were deleted will not be able to find their ballot IDs in the published list (since the server never gets to know the ballot IDs of an encrypted vote, the server admin cannot add fake votes using the same ballot IDs).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThus, in all 3 cases, the discrepancies will help detect that the server admin has been involved in some fishy activites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-happens-if-the-server-admin-changes-the-code-of-the-server-or-peeps-into-the-database\"\u003eWhat happens if the server admin changes the code of the server or peeps into the database?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis issue deals with the anonymity of the votes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet us say that the server admin rewrites the application and we can assume that any data that is sent over to the server can be read and analysed by the admin. But the interesting part is that the server only serves as a communication medium, and no actual cryptography takes place on the server.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe server admin can access the ballot IDs for all the voters\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYes, but the ballot IDs are encrypted using the passwords of all the users as the keys. The server never gets to know the plaintext password of any user (it only receives a hash for registration/login). Therefore, the server admin does not know the password of any voter, and hence they cannot decrypt the encrypted ballot IDs.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe server admin can log all the votes and voters\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYes, and then they will be able to create a map between voters and the votes that they submitted. However, note that in the last step, the votes are encrypted with the public key of the CEO. The server admin does not know the private key of the CEO and hence they can not decrypt the votes on their own. So even if they are successful in mapping each voter to a vote, they will never be able to decrypt that vote.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe key point is that the frontend is responsible for all the encryption - the backend just stores and transfers it. So even if the server admin controls the backend, they can do nothing with the data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"so-is-this-a-zero-trust-system\"\u003eSo is this a zero trust system?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot really. If the CEO and Server Admin collude and actively try to break the anonymity guarantee, they can. However, the CEO is a position of great responsibility, and in most cases it is okay to trust the CEO. I mean, after all, it is the job of the CEO to ensure that the elections are held in a fair manner. However, I believe there must exist some way so that we can fix this one issue. This is something that can be pursued as future work on this project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"funstuff\"\u003eFunstuff\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor some reason, earlier I too used to think that I needed to prove the integrity of the code running on the server in order to prove that the elections have not been meddled with. And so I started to look up research papers on that topic. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find any, and instead, I found \u003ca href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59680880/how-to-prove-that-a-server-is-running-a-certain-code\"\u003ethis answer\u003c/a\u003e, which says that it is not possible. :( I find this a rather interesting problem, something that I\u0026rsquo;d definitely like to work on.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":null,"image":{"caption":"","focal_point":"Left"},"permalink":"https://dryairship.github.io/post/online-election-manager-vs-an-untrusted-server-admin/","title":"Online Election Manager v/s an Untrusted Server Admin"},{"content":"\u003cp\u003eBefore Science and Technology Council\u0026rsquo;s summer camp 2020 began, we asked the student community at IITK for suggestions for projects that the Programming Club could build.

It is not our aim to rebuild stuff that already exists. I can think of 3 exceptions to this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIf the project serves to teach people about some technology, with hands-on experience.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIf the project has some specific use-case in the campus, and the existing versions of the application can, for some reason, not be used for that purpose.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIf the project has a new feature (as in, innovation) that would make it different from the existing applications.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApart from these exceptions, if something has already been built and is available for use (like an open source project, or an app/website), we should probably not rebuild it.

I once told a high ranked administrative official that if you asked the students to build something like Pingala, we would build something 10 times better than the Pingala you know. However, the administration is reluctant to entrust students with such an important system. This is because it is not a build-once-run-forever thing. It needs to be maintained and updated regularly, which should be done by a dedicated team. This, in their opinion, would better be handled by an outsourced team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo be fair, the administration is correct in the regard that a dedicated team is needed for the maintenance of a system like this, and that students are definitely not the right people for this job.

I\u0026rsquo;d like to mention that multiple such projects have been built but most of them are not in use, simply because the developers could not (or did not try to) convince the hall administration to use the app. We did not want to go down the same path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor this to be executed, we would require the help of the Students\u0026rsquo; Gymkhana to convince the halls to use the application. Further, we\u0026rsquo;d need to support features that may be unique to certain halls. All of this needs lots of meetings and discussions.

We\u0026rsquo;ll try to see if we can build everything that\u0026rsquo;s left, and deploy the complete version of it.

The problem is that different professors use different platforms. However, we cannot force professors to converge upon a single platform, even though that would be so much better. We can try to request the administration to enforce a single platform, but such a request is unlikely to be entertained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the second suggestion, I don\u0026rsquo;t see any point of a mobile app for Prutor. Prutor is mainly a coding plaform. Are you planning to write code on phone?

The interface could have a way where users input the link where the content is available, (or the email id), and the medium, and then the files get automatically downloaded as and when in a designated folder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen professors make their course materials available to the class, they do not give us the rights to share that content.

The next day doesn\u0026rsquo;t exactly begin at 12:00 AM. It begins after some X minutes have passed since 12:00 AM. And this X varies a lot. On some days I have had to wait more than 2 hours for my speed to return back to normal, and on some days it took less than 20 minutes. And this is extremely irritating - having to wait for an indefinite period of time for something that you should already have. (Consumer rights, yay).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fun fact is that they reset my data for the day, but don\u0026rsquo;t give me the speed.

So one day, when I had completely used up the data for the day, I waited for 12:00 AM. As soon as that happened, I tried to tweak every possible setting on my phone to check if it actually is some incorrect network setting or some eccentric behaviour of my phone. I turned the data off and then back on, I turned the airplane mode on and then off, I turned the SIM off and then back on, I edited access point names, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally I found it. \u0026ldquo;Preferred network type\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"preferred-network-type.png\" alt=\"Preferred network type\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe selected option was \u003ccode\u003e4G (recommended)\u003c/code\u003e.

The first evaluation was completed last week, and I performed poorly :p. Well, I passed, but I feel I could have done more work than I did. This post is a description of a few problems that I faced, and the things that I learnt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"mixed-signals\"\u003eMixed signals\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to use \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cpdb-libs\"\u003ecpdb-libs\u003c/a\u003e in my project, which depends on \u003ca href=\"https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/GLib-2.0/index.html\"\u003eGLib 2.0\u003c/a\u003e. So to include the \u003ccode\u003e\u0026lt;cpdb-libs-frontend.h\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e header, I needed to compile the file by linking with the \u003ccode\u003egio-unix-2.0\u003c/code\u003e package. However, just including the header file gave me a strange looking error message that made no sense to me.\n\u003cimg src=\"glib2-error.png\" alt=\"The error message\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found a hacky way around this: First I thought that I could just include the header file in the main project, with no implementation. That would not cause any conflicts, since I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t need to include the cpdb libs header. Later, I would compile the cpp file separately, without Qt. However, this idea failed because the compiler gave me \u0026lsquo;unimplemented function\u0026rsquo; errors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I decided to make a fake cpp class - it just contained dummy implementations for functions (\u003ccode\u003ecout \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026quot;inside function meow()\u0026quot;;\u003c/code\u003e :p ). Later, I separately compiled the real cpp file and moved the output file to replace the one created by Qt. I know this sounds like a crazy way to do it, but this actually worked: the functions implemented in the separately compiled file were the ones that were executed when using the Qt library! However, this led to another major problem: if I compile the actual file separate from Qt, I won\u0026rsquo;t be able to use the classes of Qt. :(\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I asked my mentor Dongxu for help. It turned out that the issue was that \u003ccode\u003eglib-2.0/gio/gio.h\u003c/code\u003e was using the identifier \u003ccode\u003esignals\u003c/code\u003e, which caused a conflict with Qt globals. Apparently, this is mentioned in Qt\u0026rsquo;s documentation for \u003ca href=\"https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/signalsandslots.html#slots\"\u003eSignals and Slots\u003c/a\u003e. The issue was resolved by doing \u003ccode\u003e#undef signals\u003c/code\u003e before including the \u003ccode\u003e\u0026lt;cpdb-libs-frontend.h\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e header. I also realized that this is probably the reason most of Qt\u0026rsquo;s identifiers begin with the letter Q - otherwise they\u0026rsquo;d cause conflicts all around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"signals-again\"\u003eSignals again\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor using the CPD backends, I had to communicate with the DBus API using a \u003ccode\u003eFrontend\u003c/code\u003e object. To initialize this object, I needed to pass two functions as callbacks - which would be executed whenever a printer is added or removed. In these functions, I put the code to add/remove the printer from the list of printers which would be used to populate the print dialog box. The problem here was that the dialog box was initialized before the DBus API could enumerate all the printers. Hence, none of the printers would appear in the dialog box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile signals were the cause of the last issue, they were the solution to this one. Dongxu told me that this would be solved by using signals and slots, so I learnt about how they worked. Then I used the callback functions to emit a signal, which was received by a slot in the dialog box. The slot was responsible for repopulating the printers in the dialog box. This way, the printers detected after the dialog box was initialized would still be added into the dialog box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"pimpl\"\u003ePIMPL\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQt quite popularly uses the \u003ca href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25250171/how-to-use-the-qts-pimpl-idiom\"\u003ePIMPL\u003c/a\u003e pattern.

That was Windows XP. A few years later, my father installed Windows 2000 alongside XP (because he needed some software for his work which required Windows 2000). And so I got to know about dual boot. My friends didn\u0026rsquo;t believe me when I told them that you could run 2 OSes on one computer. :p\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I was 15, I hacked my school\u0026rsquo;s website (no it wasn\u0026rsquo;t an SQL injection). That got me really interested in cyber security. Soon, I found that hackers use Kali Linux (*script kiddie sound intensifies*). So I downloaded the ISO and did a live boot. I didn\u0026rsquo;t understand much, but it seemed cool. Then I read more about linux. I found out that Kali is not for beginners, and that it is a \u0026ldquo;debian-based\u0026rdquo; distro. I misinterpreted that as \u0026ldquo;it would be easier to learn how to use debian\u0026rdquo;. So the next day I downloaded the debian ISO and did a Live Boot. I didn\u0026rsquo;t understand much, again. And TBH, it didn\u0026rsquo;t even seem \u0026ldquo;cool\u0026rdquo;. But still I wanted to install it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I followed some blog to dual boot Windows and Debian and started following it. I know you\u0026rsquo;re expecting this :p - I messed up some steps and ended up replacing Windows 7 with Debian. I also lost all my files :(.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I could have lived with using Debian instead of Windows, I definitely couldn\u0026rsquo;t have lived without my files. So I started looking for file recovery softwares. Since I was an absolute beginner at linux, I didn\u0026rsquo;t know how to install/run/use linux programs. Hence, I reinstalled Windows 7 and removed Debian. Finally, I ran a data recovery software and recovered most of my files.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was quite an adventure. However, I didn\u0026rsquo;t stop, and before starting college I had tried Fedora and Mint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"more-noob-days\"\u003eMore Noob days\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I got my own laptop, I installed Ubuntu (because everyone else was doing that :P). On the 1TB hard disk, I made 4 partitions - 2 NTFS (for Windows 10) and 2 ext4 (for Ubuntu) (A few months later that changed to 1 NTFS and 3 ext4 :p ). Others were making a separate home partition for ubuntu, while I installed it entirely in one partition. A separate home partition didn\u0026rsquo;t make sense to me then. In Programming Club\u0026rsquo;s winter camp, I asked \u003ca href=\"https://yashsriv.org\"\u003eYash\u003c/a\u003e why someone would need a separate home partition, and his answer was pretty much the same as \u003ca href=\"https://askubuntu.com/questions/142695/what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-having-a-separate-home-partition\"\u003ethis\u003c/a\u003e.

VirtualBox was giving me some strange errors and so I deemed it better to install it alongside Ubuntu and Windows. However, before installing, I recalled the thing about a separate home directory, and thought it would have been better had I known that before installing Ubuntu. :(\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThankfully, I found \u003ca href=\"https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Partitioning/Home/Moving\"\u003ethis page\u003c/a\u003e on Ubuntu Documentation which has detailed steps regarding shifting home directory to a different partition. This was exactly what I needed, and it helped me set up a separate home partition successfully. I then installed Kali, and voila - I had a triple boot laptop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"end-of-noob-days\"\u003eEnd of noob days\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShifting my home directory to a different partition, and succesfully installing Kali alongside Ubuntu and Windows - both in one day, got me pretty excited. Now I wasn\u0026rsquo;t scared of installing OSes. For my GSoC application, I was given a task related to reproducing an error on Debian Buster - and I installed it as the 4th OS on my computer. Installing OSes is more fun than it appears to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"noob-days-are-back\"\u003eNoob days are back\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne day, I was working on some python code and it required me to install a library. The python3 on my Ubuntu was python3.6, while the library required python3.7. So I installed python3.7. However, that led to new problems. So I wanted to remove python3.6. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find any way to remove just python3.6, and leave python3.7 untouched. So I made an amazing plan - completely remove python3, and reinstall python3.7. Sounds like a good plan, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so I purged \u003ccode\u003epython3-dev\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003epython3\u003c/code\u003e (Yes I really did that). The next moment, it gave me a list of some 100+ packages to be removed. I was like, yeah cool whatever I\u0026rsquo;m just going to press enter. And so it started uninstalling. While it was at it, I searched about the repercussions on uninstalling python3-dev and python3. I found \u003ca href=\"https://askubuntu.com/questions/1036249/removed-python-3-on-18-04-how-can-i-fix-my-system?noredirect=1\u0026amp;lq=1\"\u003ethis\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://askubuntu.com/questions/810854/i-deleted-package-python3-on-ubuntu-and-i-have-lost-dashboard-terminal-and-un\"\u003ethis\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://askubuntu.com/questions/384033/removed-python-3-and-now-ubuntu-software-center-terminal-and-other-applications\"\u003ethis\u003c/a\u003e.

The answers in the linked questions didn\u0026rsquo;t help me. Also, Ubuntu 20 had been released about 3-4 days ago, and it would have been an easy option to overwrite Ubuntu 18 with Ubuntu 20. But I also wanted to try out Arch. And Yash recommended me to use Arch. So I installed Arch by overwriting the Debian Buster installation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"shooing-away-noob-days-again\"\u003eShooing away noob days, again\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I used the same home directory for Kali and Ubuntu, starting the terminal in Kali game me warnings regarding some packages not being found. So I assumed that I\u0026rsquo;d get even more warnings if I try to share the same home with Arch. So instead of adding the home partition as an entry in fstab, I decided to create a new folder on the existing home partition, and create a symlink for it to be used as my home on Arch. Inside that folder, I have further symlinks for the folders that I\u0026rsquo;d want to share across partitions (like Desktop, Downloads, \u0026hellip;). This way, my files remain shared across partitions, but each partition gets its own config files, libraries, executables, etc. This is how my symlink solution looks like:\n\u003cimg src=\"home-symlinks.png\" alt=\"Symlinking home\"\u003e\nThe separate home partition is mounted at \u003ccode\u003e/mnt/home\u003c/code\u003e. It has a folder \u003ccode\u003earch\u003c/code\u003e which I use as my home directory on my Arch system. \u003ccode\u003e/mnt/home/dryairship\u003c/code\u003e is the home directory that I used in Ubuntu 18.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"will-noob-days-be-back\"\u003eWill noob days be back?\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA week ago, I overwrote the Ubuntu 18 partition with Ubuntu 20 (I needed Ubuntu to check something related to my GSoC project). Ubuntu reminds me of noob days, so I\u0026rsquo;m sticking to Arch as my main system for now.

Searching for \u0026ldquo;Slack bot for competitve programming\u0026rdquo; didn\u0026rsquo;t give me any useful results.

This was supposed to be easy. However, TLE bot\u0026rsquo;s code uses the \u003ccode\u003ediscord\u003c/code\u003e library at a lot of places.

There was a network with the name \u003ccode\u003ectfd_default\u003c/code\u003e, whose subnet contained the IP address of the Reverse Proxy VM. This network was automatically created when I started the CTFd docker container using docker-compose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo whenever the Reverse Proxy VM would make a request to the Gymkhana VM, it would respond back correctly. But now since the IP of the Reverse Proxy VM was contained in the docker network subnet, the response would go to the docker network, and would never actually reach the Reverse Proxy VM.

And due to the COVID-19 vacations, I finally got the time to try it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I installed Rust and read a few pages of \u003ca href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html\"\u003eRust by Example\u003c/a\u003e. Then I came across this problem about \u003ca href=\"https://blog.tanyakhovanova.com/2020/03/a-game-with-the-devil/\"\u003ea game of coins with the Devil\u003c/a\u003e, and decided to implement the game as my first project in Rust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI believe in learning languages the hard way. I learnt Java by experimenting. I used to copy code that I didn\u0026rsquo;t understand, then modified small parts, observed the changes, and repeated this until I understood the entire code. And I learnt python and C++ by by using them to re-write the same programs that I wrote in Java. This also taught me how to use Google properly. I learnt Go by deciding that I\u0026rsquo;d use it to build my best self project yet (an \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/dryairship/online-election-manager\"\u003eonline election system\u003c/a\u003e), when I hardly knew how to write Hello World in it; and I learnt it not by following some guide, but by searching for \u0026ldquo;how to do X in Go\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo why should Rust be an exception? I created a new cargo project and started modifying it. I really liked that creating a new project is as simple as doing \u003ccode\u003ecargo new project-name\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first thing that I had to do was to take an integer as an input. I was awfully disappointed that there is no direct way to take an integer input: we first have to input a string and then parse it into an integer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJava, at one point, used to be my favourite language. And Java libraries use the camelCase/PascalCase for all naming purposes (except for CONSTANTS). Now Go is my favourite language. And Go too uses a similar convention. Therefore, all my life, I\u0026rsquo;ve preferred using the camelCase. And now I\u0026rsquo;m writing code in a language that gives me a warning, asking me to convert camelCase variable names to snake_case. First turn-off. :p\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the input part was ready, I ran it using \u003ccode\u003ecargo run\u003c/code\u003e. It seemed to take infinity to compile - when I realized that it was in fact waiting for the input. However, I had \u003ccode\u003eprint!\u003c/code\u003eed a string before asking for the input, which was not displayed. Flushing problem, I recognized. Changing \u003ccode\u003eprint!\u003c/code\u003e to \u003ccode\u003eprintln!\u003c/code\u003e did the work, but I still wanted the input to be taken on the same line as the prompt. So I had to add another statement to flush - a rather scary looking statement that required a new Trait to be imported. I didn\u0026rsquo;t really like having to manually flush after \u003ccode\u003eprint!\u003c/code\u003eing, but there has been a \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/23818\"\u003ehuge discussion over this\u003c/a\u003e and the community believes this is the way it should be. :(\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the next step, I had to create an array of the size that I had just inputted. The error messages told me that I could not use a variable for the size of the array - it had to be a constant. LoL what? I then found that the way to do it is by using a vector. Fair enough. Then I realized that an \u003ccode\u003ei32\u003c/code\u003e value could not be used as an array/vector index; it had to be a \u003ccode\u003eusize\u003c/code\u003e.  Reasonable, since array indices should be positive. However, I believe an automatic type conversion should have been implemented (again, the subject of \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29010\"\u003ea huge discussion\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI then had to randomly initialize the vector. Turns out, I have to add an \u003cstrong\u003eexternal crate\u003c/strong\u003e as a dependency to generate random numbers. Seriously? In my opinion, random number generation is something as fundamental as I/O and should have been present in the standard library of Rust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point, I had a randomly initialized array. I now needed to update it using inputs from the user. I was about to face the most dreaded error any Rust beginner could face : \u003ccode\u003eerror[E0382]: use of moved value\u003c/code\u003e. The concept of this error doesn\u0026rsquo;t even exist in other languages. \u003cem\u003eSo I modified the vector in an iteration of the while loop and now I can\u0026rsquo;t use the vector in the while condition? LMAO why?\u003c/em\u003e It took me an entire day to figure it out, and I have probably not yet properly understood it. I somehow managed to solve it, but I still don\u0026rsquo;t know if the way I did it is the way it was supposed to be done. I\u0026rsquo;ll need to understand the idea of ownership before I pick up any other project in Rust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that was it - an utterly disappointing experience. I once overheard \u003ca href=\"https://yashsriv.org/\"\u003eyashsriv\u003c/a\u003e saying that anyone denigrating Rust online would be hurled abuses at. So perhaps I should brace for that. The program is available on GitHub at \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/dryairship/coins-and-the-devil\"\u003edryairship/coins-and-the-devil\u003c/a\u003e.

He had just returned from the mid-semester examination of an MTH course. The subject of our concern was the format of the examination - a rather unusual one for such a consequential test. The test had 5 True/False questions, with a +3 for a correct answer, a -2 for an incorrect answer, and a 0 for an unattempted question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe curious marking scheme of this exam made one thing intuitively clear to both of us - if you don\u0026rsquo;t know the answer, making a guess \u003cem\u003eshould be\u003c/em\u003e better than not attempting the question. And so Bose exclaimed, \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;LMAO some students left the entire paper blank. They could have marked all the answers \u0026lsquo;True\u0026rsquo; and still have a fair chance of a positive score!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;But why all \u0026lsquo;True\u0026rsquo;? You could just mark all the answers according to your intuition and that should effectively be at least as good as random guessing\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e, I argued. Bose then asserted that random guessing may get you all your answers wrong, and the \u0026ldquo;all True / all False\u0026rdquo; method should be preferred. While Bose may have stated that impetuously, it \u003cabbr title=\"Koi sense hai is baat ki? Hame bohot lag rahi thi uss time. :p\"\u003edid get both of us thinking.\u003c/abbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy roommate Daljit gatecrashed the discussion and sided with Bose. However, after fiddling with pen and paper for some time, Bose yielded that \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;mathematically both the methods appear to have the same effect\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e. Obviously, the probability of getting all 5 answers incorrect in both the cases remains \\( (0.5)^5 \\).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow consider this: If you had to answer all the questions in a set of 5 True/False type questions, there are 32 possible ways you could do this. While calculating our probability of \\( (0.5)^5 = 0.03125\\), we have assumed that all of these ways are equally likely to be the answer set that has all incorrect answers. Instinctively, this seems unrealistic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I were to set a question paper, I would try to maintain a balance between the number of True statements and the number of False statements. This idea is easier to visualize when there are more number of questions and more alternatives. Consider the JEE Main question paper : 90 questions, one correct option out of 4 alternatives (a), (b), (c) and (d). There is \u003cstrong\u003eabsolutely no way\u003c/strong\u003e (realistically) that the answer to all the questions be (a). In fact, it is expected that the number of questions with (a) as the correct answer would be roughly a quarter of the total number of questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo when it comes to 5 True/False questions, it is not expected that all the answers be the same. And hence, marking all True / all False should have a better chance at not getting all the answers wrong, than randomly marking the answers. This needs a better mathematical analysis, but Bose got AIR 104 in JEE Advanced and so his advice regarding examinations should not be taken lightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNevertheless, the marking scheme of the examination was such that would promote guessing. And this can be proven with some quick mathematics. Consider any examination where you have to select one out of \\(N\\) options. You get \\(x\\) points when you correctly answer a question, \\(-y\\) points when you incorrectly answer a question, and zero for not attempting the the question.\nThus, if you randonly guess an answer, the probabilty that you get it correct is \\(\\frac{1}{N}\\). If you\u0026rsquo;re making a random guess for \\(Q\\) questions, then the total expected score due guessing would be :\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}\n\u0026amp; Q[\\frac{1}{N}x + (1-\\frac{1}{N})(-y)] \\\\\\\\\n= \u0026amp; \\frac{Q}{N}[x - (N-1)y]\n\\end{array}\n$$\nFor an examination where random guessing should not make any difference, the expected score due to guessing should be equal to zero. With this condition, we can solve for \\(y\\).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l}\n\\frac{Q}{N}[x - (N-1)y] \u0026amp; = \u0026amp; 0 \\\\\\\\\nx - (N-1)y \u0026amp; = \u0026amp; 0 \\\\\\\\\n\\frac{x}{N-1} \u0026amp; = \u0026amp; y\n\\end{array}\n$$\nTherefore, in an ideal 1-out-of-N examination, the penalty for an incorrect answer should be \\(-\\frac{x}{N-1}\\).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo compare, Bose\u0026rsquo;s examination had a penatly of -2 instead of the ideal -3 (\\(x=3, N=2\\)), which implies that random guessing could leave one better off. JEE Main has a penalty of -1, but ideally it should have a penalty of -\\(\\frac{4}{3}\\) (\\(x=4, N=4\\)). This is why I have always promoted guessing in JEE Main. I myself did that, and got a +7 in my score due to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve always been a proponent of guessing, wherever the situation promotes it. And this comes in handy during quizzes. Almost all the time, you don\u0026rsquo;t know the exact answer for a question. It is all about working over the hints that the quizmaster subtly drops and making an educated guess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember when we went to participate in the Farida Abraham Memorial National Quiz in the La Martiniere Girls\u0026rsquo; College, I didn\u0026rsquo;t know the answer to any of the questions in the preliminary round. We still qualified for the finals just by making educated guesses. Ask any quizzer and they would recall a similar story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuesswork lies at the heart of quizzing. And it is the job of a good quizmaster to drop enough hints, and smart hints, such that the teams try to guess reasonable answers. Even if the answer is incorrect, a \u0026ldquo;good guess\u0026rdquo; from the quizmaster is a satisfactory consolation prize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, and we have made such progress on guessing that we have an entirely new field where computers are trained to guess \u0026ldquo;values\u0026rdquo;. Yes I\u0026rsquo;m talking about Machine Learning. This reminds me that I have to brush up my ML.

Overall, it felt like I knew what I was doing and why I was doing that. So now it was time for my own theories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"network-structure\"\u003eNetwork Structure\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe network had 3 layers - the input layer, one hidden layer, and the output layer.\u003cbr\u003e\nThe images in the MNIST dataset are of size 28 x 28. Thus the input layer was of size 784. The hidden layer was chosen to be of size 100. And since we were using one-hot encoding, our output layer was of size 10.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs such, there were supposed to be two pairs of weights and biases - one for the transition from the input layer to the hidden layer, and one for the transition from the hidden layer to the output layer. So the first set of weights was a matrix of size 784x100, and the second was a matrix of size 100x10.

We take the product of this array (1 x 784) with the first weight matrix (784 x 100) to get an array of size 1 x 100. We add the values of the first bias array to this to get the intermediate answer array. We then take the product of the intermediate answer array (1 x 100) and the second weight matrix (100 x 10) to get an array of size 1 x 10.  Adding the second set of biases to this, we get the final answer array. Passing the values of this array to the softmax function, we obtain a \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003escore\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e between 0 and 1 for each digit.

Having tried my hands at all sorts of online resources, this time I decide to use a physical book as my guide. So I go to the library and pick up this book titled \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Constraint-Based-Marco-Ph-D/dp/0081006594\"\u003eMachine Learning: A constraint-based approach\u003c/a\u003e by Professor Marco Gori.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is 2 AM, I\u0026rsquo;m on chapter one, and the current topic is why Euclidean distance is not a good metric in higher dimensions. So we\u0026rsquo;re working in the n-dimensional set \\( \\mathbb{X} \\) and the author defines the set of neighbours of a point \\(x_{0}\\) as :\n$$ \\mathcal{N}_R (x_{0}) = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{X}\\,\\, |\\,\\, ||x-x_{0}|| \u0026lt; R\\}$$\nwhere \\(R\\) is the degree of neighbourhood of \\(x_{0}\\) (i.e., the radius). We call this the orange. He then brings up the formula for the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_of_an_n-ball\"\u003evolume of an n-ball\u003c/a\u003e (which I\u0026rsquo;ve never seen before) :\n\u003ca title=\"Volume of an n-ball\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Volume of an n-ball\" style=\"filter: invert(1); -webkit-filter: invert(1);\" src=\"https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4247a3f5a3cc59a2dc1b08af20ec7a210db1ca06\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\nwhere \\(n\\) is the number of dimensions, \\(R\\) is the radius of the ball, and \\(\\Gamma\\) is the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function\"\u003eGamma function\u003c/a\u003e.\nTrusting the author without verifying the veracity of the formula (as I\u0026rsquo;ve always done), I move on to the definiton of the peel of this orange. We define \\(\\epsilon \u0026gt; 0\\) as the thickness of the peel, which we denote as \\(\\mathcal{P}_{\\epsilon}\\). The radius of the pulp, therefore, reduces to \\(R-\\epsilon\\). The volume of the peel is then obtained by subtracting the volume of the pulp from the volume of the orange.\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nvol(\\mathcal{P}_{\\epsilon}) \u0026amp;= vol(\\mathcal{N}_R) - vol(\\mathcal{N}_{R-\\epsilon})\\\\\\\\\n\u0026amp;= vol(\\mathcal{N}_R) \\left(1 - \\frac{vol(\\mathcal{N}_{R-\\epsilon})}{vol(\\mathcal{N}_R)}\\right)\\\\\\\\\n\u0026amp;= vol(\\mathcal{N}_R) \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{R-\\epsilon}{R}\\right)^{n}\\right)\n\\end{align}\n$$\nNow we let the dimensions increase. Formally, we let \\(n \\to \\infty\\).\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nvol(\\mathcal{P}_{\\epsilon}) \u0026amp;= vol(\\mathcal{N}_R) \\left(1 - \\lim \\limits_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(\\frac{R-\\epsilon}{R}\\right)^{n}\\right)\n\\end{align}\n$$\nSince \\(R-\\epsilon \u0026lt; R\\), we have \\(\\frac{R-\\epsilon}{R}\u0026lt;1\\) which implies \\( \\lim \\limits_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(\\frac{R-\\epsilon}{R}\\right)^{n}\\ = 0\\).\nThus, we get\n$$\nvol(\\mathcal{P}_{\\epsilon}) = vol(\\mathcal{N}_R)\n$$\nand the orange becomes its peel. This is it. This blows my mind.

No. I merely verified that it holds for 1, 2 and 3 dimensions. But what if there is some catch in higher dimensions, I wonder as I lie down on my bed. I then lazily conclude that the author must have checked the proof before writing the formula in his book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWere we discussing about how Euclidean metrics fail in higher dimensions? No. We were discussing about a greedy orange-loving alien who has invented a dimension-changinator and would be wanting to increase the number of dimensions of his orange, and how he would be disappointed to get only the peel if he increases the number of dimensions to very large values.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":null,"image":{"caption":"","focal_point":""},"permalink":"https://dryairship.github.io/post/learning-machine-learning-story-n/","title":"Learning Machine Learning : Story #N"},{"content":"\u003ch2 id=\"the-title-is-a-clickbait\"\u003eThe title is a clickbait\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot exactly, hehe.\u003cbr\u003e\n✔️   It was my first flight.\u003cbr\u003e\n✔️   The flight stalled.\u003cbr\u003e\n✔️   I was scared.\u003cbr\u003e\n❌   I thought I was going to die.\u003cbr\u003e\nThe stall was a planned one, you see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"aerospace-is-the-coooooolest-department\"\u003eAerospace is the coooooolest department\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the 3rd semester, AE students have the course AE201 - Introduction to Aerospace Engineering.

(\u003cem\u003eDon\u0026rsquo;t judge me.

And I had never explicitly set the variable to 0. I just kept on increasing the value of the variable (in another static function - which did the calculations), and returned it when the calculations were over. Thus, when I called the function the second time, the variable still contained its previous value. Hence, I got \u003ccode\u003e7\u003c/code\u003e = \u003ccode\u003e1\u003c/code\u003e+\u003ccode\u003e6\u003c/code\u003e as my answer for the second test case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecompiling a program in BlueJ resets the Java Virtual Machine.
